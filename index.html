		<p>A 2021 study by McKinsey & Company found that there is a serious lack of representation for minority groups in Hollywood. To start, there are few stories which depict minorities or marginalized groups. Moreover, Hollywoodâ€™s network of directors, producers, and actors lacks diversity with the majority of its community composed of white, older males. The resulting effects of this homogenized society is that it places white personas and stories as superior to those of marginalized groups and minorities.</p>

        <p>This website serves as an introduction to films that celebrate diversity. In particular, they either contain either a racially diverse cast or strong LGBT characters. Through the lens of this project, readers will be able to understand the importance of diversity in Hollywood, engage in thoughtful conversations with others, and subsequently seek out further films that portray diversity and underrepresented groups.</p>
