        <p>Movies are an integral part of our culture. Not only are they a source of entertainment - they also inform our thoughts, values, and opinions. Diverse stories, by their very nature, promote inclusion and acceptance. Greater diversity in Hollywood will lead to new and better opportunities for the actors and actresses playing these characters. The selections presented on this website are only a brief glimpse into the vast array of diverse films. Thus, they can be used as a starting point for further discovery into a diverse and varied film culture.</p>
